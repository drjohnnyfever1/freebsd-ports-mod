New Moon is a browser built with most of the code of Pale Moon(TM), but is not
affiliated at all with Pale Moon nor Moonchild Productions, in the sense that
it is a third-party build which is not endorsed by them. Nonetheless, we try to
stick with their official Linux build instructions, as much as practically
feasible on FreeBSD.

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built from
its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from
Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with carefully selected features
and optimizations to improve the browser's stability and user experience, while
offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes
to make the browser truly your own.

Some of the main features:
- Based on the Unified XUL Platform (UXP) containing our own optimized layout
  and rendering engine (Goanna).
- Safe: Forked from mature Mozilla code and regularly updated with the latest
  security patches.
- Secure: Additional security features and security-aware development
- Zero ads; no telemetry, spyware or data gathering
- Familiar, efficient, fully customizable interface
